[Single Cell Portal](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/single_cell) (SCP) is a visualization portal developed by Broad Institute for single cell RNA-seq data. It facilitates sharing scientific results and disseminating datasets, fostering an environment of open science and open data. All data can be made available for download by study authors. 

Studies can be private, shared privately, public with embargoed data, and public with public data. Single Cell Portal integrates closely with FireCloud, Broad's open and cloud-based genomics analysis platform, and is also aligning with open metadata vocabularies standardized by the Human Cell Atlas. 

During the Bio-IT FAIR Data hackathon, we aim to enhance the FAIRness of Single Cell Portal and FireCloud as used in SCP, for example by improving the accessibility of analysis metadata.
